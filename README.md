# SwiftUICatalog

Can you imagine how UIs works from API references?
I created a catalog app showing minimum implementation and execution result for each the API.

SwiftUI has many references to get started.
SwiftUI Tutorial is the best to know how much potential SwiftUI has.
But it is a littel complex to research how to use each the API.

This app currently targets iOS and refers to https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui

# Requirement

There are some sections to categorize the APIs as follows.
